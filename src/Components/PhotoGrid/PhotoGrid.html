<!--PhotoGrid. This will display a 2x2 grid of individual Post items on desktop/tablet, and will render an individual swipable Post item
    on mobile. It only needs to contain a single div which will hold a function that maps over returned Post items. It may be necessary
    to render the Post items into an array, so they can be rendered 2x2 on desktop and individually on mobile.-->
